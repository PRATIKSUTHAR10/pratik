    <h3><font color="yellow"><font size="8"> Nine Simple Things You Can Do to Help Protect the Environment given below</font></h3>
    <p><font color="green"><font size="5"><b>
        <pre>
       1. Reduce, reuse, and recycle: Cut down on what you throw away. Follow the three "R's" to <br>conserve natural resources and landfill space.

       2.Volunteer: Volunteer for cleanups in your community. You can get involved in protecting your <br>watershed, too.

       3.Educate: When you further your own education, you can help others understand the importance and <br>value of our natural resources.

       4.Conserve water: The less water you use, the less runoff and wastewater that eventually end up in <br>the ocean.

       5.Shop wisely: Buy less plastic and bring a reusable shopping bag.

       6.Use long-lasting light bulbs: Energy efficient light bulbs reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Also <br>flip the light switch off when you leave the room!

       7.Plant a tree. Trees provide food and oxygen: They help save energy, clean the air, and help combat <br>climate change.

       8.Don't send chemicals into our waterways: Choose non-toxic chemicals in the home and office.

        9.Bike more: Drive less.
